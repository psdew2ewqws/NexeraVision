# Quick Fix Guide: Enable Local Printer Printing from Cloud Backend

**Problem**: "I added a new printer to my local device but the production didn't print it"

**Root Cause**: Cloud backend (31.57.166.18) cannot access USB printer on your local machine without bridge software

**Solution**: Install PrinterMaster Desktop App (5-10 minutes)

## Step-by-Step Fix (5-10 Minutes)

### Step 1: Download PrinterMaster Desktop App

**Option A - Download from Backend Server** (Recommended):
```
1. Open browser
2. Go to: https://31.57.166.18/downloads/PrinterMaster-Setup.exe
3. Save file to Downloads folder
```

**Option B - Get from IT Team**:
- Ask IT for PrinterMaster installer
- Usually named: `PrinterMaster-Setup.exe` (Windows)

### Step 2: Install the Application

**Windows**:
```
1. Double-click: PrinterMaster-Setup.exe
2. Click "Yes" on security prompt
3. Click "Next" in installation wizard
4. Accept license agreement
5. Choose installation location (default is fine)
6. Click "Install"
7. Wait for installation (1-2 minutes)
8. Click "Finish"
```

**Important**: If Windows Defender blocks it, click "More info" → "Run anyway"

### Step 3: Configure PrinterMaster (First Launch)

When the app opens for the first time, you'll see a configuration screen:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PrinterMaster Configuration              │
├───────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                           │
│  License Key: [Ask your manager]          │
│                                           │
│  Backend URL:                             │
│  https://31.57.166.18:3001                │
│  (Usually pre-filled)                     │
│                                           │
│  WebSocket URL:                           │
│  wss://31.57.166.18:3002                  │
│  (Usually pre-filled)                     │
│                                           │
│  [ Cancel ]              [ Connect ]      │
└───────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What to Enter**:
1. **License Key**: Ask your manager/IT for your branch's license key
2. **Backend URL**: Should already say `https://31.57.166.18:3001` ✓
3. **WebSocket URL**: Should already say `wss://31.57.166.18:3002` ✓

Click **"Connect"**

### Step 4: Verify It's Working

After clicking Connect, the app will:

1. **Validate License** (2-3 seconds)
   - Shows loading spinner
   - Retrieves branch information

2. **Discover Printers** (5-10 seconds)
   - Scans USB ports
   - Finds your POS-80C printer
   - Shows: "Found 1 printer: POS-80C"

3. **Connect to Backend** (1-2 seconds)
   - Establishes WebSocket connection
   - Shows: "Connected ✓" in green

4. **Register Printers** (2-3 seconds)
   - Sends printer info to backend
   - Shows: "POS-80C registered successfully"

**Success Indicators**:
- ✅ System tray icon: Shows green "connected" status
- ✅ App window: Shows "Connected" with timestamp
- ✅ Printers list: Shows your POS-80C as "Online"

### Step 5: Test Printing from Web Dashboard

Now test from the web interface:

```
1. Open browser
2. Go to: https://31.57.166.18:3000
3. Login with your credentials
4. Navigate to: Settings → Printing
5. You should see:
   - "Desktop App: Connected ✓" (green)
   - Your printer "POS-80C" with "Online" status
6. Click the "Test Print" button on POS-80C
7. Your local printer should print a test receipt!
```

**Expected Result**: Physical receipt prints on your local printer

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "License key invalid"

**Fix**:
- Double-check the license key (no spaces, correct format)
- Contact your manager for the correct key
- Make sure you're using the key for YOUR branch (not another location)

### Problem: "Cannot connect to backend"

**Fix**:
```
1. Check internet connection
2. Try opening in browser: https://31.57.166.18:3001/health
   - Should show: {"status":"ok"}
3. Check if firewall is blocking the app:
   - Windows: Settings → Windows Security → Firewall & network protection
   - Click "Allow an app through firewall"
   - Find "PrinterMaster" and check both Private and Public boxes
4. Restart the app
```

### Problem: "Printer not discovered"

**Fix**:
```
1. Check printer is:
   ✅ Powered on
   ✅ Connected via USB cable
   ✅ Not showing any error lights

2. Check printer shows in Windows:
   - Control Panel → Devices and Printers
   - Should see your printer listed

3. If not showing:
   - Install printer driver
   - Try different USB port
   - Restart computer

4. In PrinterMaster app:
   - Click "Refresh Printers" button
   - Wait 10 seconds for scan to complete
```

### Problem: "Test print fails"

**Fix**:
```
1. Check printer status in app:
   - Should show "Online" (green)
   - If "Offline" (red), check printer connection

2. Check printer paper:
   - Printer needs paper to print
   - Make sure paper roll is loaded correctly

3. Try printing from Windows directly:
   - Open Notepad
   - Type "Test"
   - File → Print → Select your printer
   - If this works, issue is with app integration

4. Check app logs:
   - In PrinterMaster, go to: Menu → View Logs
   - Look for error messages
   - Send logs to IT support if needed
```

### Problem: "App keeps disconnecting"

**Fix**:
```
1. Check internet stability:
   - Open: https://31.57.166.18:3001/health
   - Should load consistently
   - If intermittent, contact network admin

2. Disable VPN if running:
   - Some VPNs interfere with WebSocket connections
   - Try with VPN off

3. Check app settings:
   - Menu → Settings
   - "Auto-reconnect" should be ENABLED
   - "Reconnect interval" should be 5 seconds

4. Restart app:
   - Right-click system tray icon
   - Click "Quit"
   - Restart PrinterMaster
```
