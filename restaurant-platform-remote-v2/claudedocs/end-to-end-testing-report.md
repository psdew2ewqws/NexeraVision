## ⚠️ Issues Identified

### **Minor Issue**: Platform Product Assignment Error
- **Workflow**: Multi-Platform Channel Assignment
- **Status**: ❌ HTTP 500 ERROR
- **Failed Step**: Product assignment to platform endpoint
- **Error**: Internal server error during `POST /menu/platforms/{id}/products`
- **Root Cause**: Likely service-side validation or database constraint issue
- **Impact**: Low - Platform creation works, only assignment fails
- **Fix Required**: Backend investigation of product assignment endpoint

**Technical Details**:
```
Request: POST /api/v1/menu/platforms/94540008-0ddf-47ad-a871-94753ff0b045/products
Payload: {"productIds":["eac1c376-d3fd-4040-9f4a-41276941e916"]}
Response: {"statusCode": 500, "message": "Internal server error"}
```

**Resolution Steps**:
1. Check backend logs for specific error details
2. Validate product assignment service logic
3. Test database foreign key constraints
4. Verify company-based data access controls
