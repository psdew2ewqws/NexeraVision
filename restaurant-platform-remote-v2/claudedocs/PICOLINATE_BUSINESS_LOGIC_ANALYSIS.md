## 1. ORDER MANAGEMENT RULES & WORKFLOWS

### 1.1 Order Lifecycle Management
```sql
-- Core Order States & Transitions
ORDER STATES:
- iscanceled (boolean) - Order cancelled by customer/restaurant
- isdeclined (boolean) - Order rejected by restaurant
- isedited (boolean) - Order modified after creation
- iscomplained (boolean) - Customer complaint logged
- isready (boolean) - Order prepared and ready
- isseen (timestamp) - When restaurant acknowledged order

BUSINESS RULE: Order flows through orderstatuspossibilities table
- Each branch can have custom status workflows
- Status transitions controlled by nextstatus field
- cancancel flag determines cancellation eligibility at each stage
```

### 1.2 Order Acceptance/Rejection Criteria
```sql
-- Auto-rejection conditions discovered in database functions:

1. BRANCH AVAILABILITY CHECKS:
   - Branch status must = 1 (active)
   - Current time within opentime/closetime window
   - Branch must have active menu (hasactivemenu = true)

2. DELIVERY DISTANCE VALIDATION:
   - Distance calculated using getbranchfordistance()
   - Must be within branchcalculator range OR branchdelivery maxdistance
   - If no delivery options available → auto-reject

3. PRODUCT AVAILABILITY:
   - Product must be available in productavailability table
   - Category availability checked via branchavailability
   - Stock levels validated for inventory control

4. PAYMENT METHOD VALIDATION:
   - Payment type must be supported by branch
   - Restaurant payment credentials validated
```

### 1.3 Priority Order Handling
```sql
-- Order priority determined by multiple factors:
1. ORDER SOURCE PRIORITY:
   - Call Center: Manual handling, immediate processing
   - Talabat: Platform integration priority
   - Careem: Express delivery priority
   - Online Ordering: Standard priority
   - Mobile App: Push notification priority
   - Chatbot: Automated processing

2. DELIVERY COMPANY PRIORITY:
   - branchdelivery.priority field (1-5 scale)
   - Higher priority = preferred selection
   - Failover to lower priority if unavailable
```

### 1.4 Peak Hour Management
```sql
-- Time-based business rules:
1. BRANCH OPERATING HOURS:
   - opentime/closetime define availability windows
   - Orders outside hours → automatically declined
   - Scheduled orders validated against future availability

2. PREPARATION TIME CALCULATIONS:
   - totalpreparingtime aggregated from product prep times
   - Dynamic adjustment based on order volume
   - Delivery time estimation includes prep + travel time
```

---

## 2. PRICING & FINANCIAL LOGIC

### 2.1 Dynamic Pricing Algorithm
```sql
-- Multi-tier pricing structure discovered:

PRICING HIERARCHY:
1. Base Product Price (price jsonb field)
2. Channel-Specific Pricing (by ordersource)
3. Branch-Specific Overrides
4. Time-Based Adjustments (peak hours)
5. Customer-Specific Pricing (loyalty tiers)

-- Price calculation function pattern:
getattributepricebyid(_id uuid, _channel citext) → (price, tax_percentage)
```

### 2.2 Commission & Fee Calculations
```sql
-- Commission structure (from orderprice table):
orderprice TABLE:
- ordertotal: Base order value
- ordertotalwithouttax: Pre-tax amount
- deliveryprice: Delivery fee
- orderdiscount: Applied discount amount
- deliverydiscount: Delivery discount
- ordertax: Tax amount
- servicefee: Platform commission
- grandtotal: Final amount

COMMISSION CALCULATION LOGIC:
servicefee = (ordertotal * commission_rate) + fixed_fee
where commission_rate varies by:
- Order source (Talabat vs Careem vs direct)
- Restaurant agreement tier
- Order volume (bulk discounts)
```

### 2.3 Delivery Pricing Calculator
```sql
-- Distance-based delivery pricing:
branchcalculator TABLE:
- startperiod: Distance range start (km)
- endperiod: Distance range end (km)
- price: Delivery fee for this range

ALGORITHM:
getbranchdeliverycalculatorprice(branch_id, distance):
  SELECT price FROM branchcalculator
  WHERE startperiod <= distance AND endperiod > distance

DELIVERY COMPANY INTEGRATION:
- Each delivery provider has different pricing models
- System selects optimal provider based on:
  * Distance coverage (maxdistance in branchdelivery)
  * Priority ranking
  * Real-time availability
  * Cost optimization
```

### 2.4 Discount Application Rules
```sql
-- Sophisticated discount engine:
promocode TABLE RULES:
- type: percentage, fixed_amount, free_delivery
- daysofweek[]: Valid days (1=Monday, 7=Sunday)
- minprice: Minimum order value
- minquantity: Minimum item count
- maxvalue: Maximum discount cap
- numberofusecustomer: Per-customer usage limit
- numberofusage: Total usage limit
- priority: Application order (higher = first)

DISCOUNT STACKING LOGIC:
1. Sort by priority (highest first)
2. Apply percentage discounts before fixed amounts
3. Check category/product/branch restrictions
4. Validate customer eligibility
5. Ensure min/max constraints
6. Track usage counts

DISCOUNT CONFLICT RESOLUTION:
- Multiple discounts can apply if compatible
- Customer-specific discounts override general ones
- Channel restrictions enforced (discountchannel table)
```

### 2.5 Multi-Currency Handling
```sql
-- Currency support discovered:
deliverycompany.currency field suggests multi-currency support
- Each delivery company operates in specific currency
- Currency conversion likely handled at integration layer
- Base prices stored in restaurant's local currency
```

---

## 3. DELIVERY LOGIC & ALGORITHMS

### 3.1 Delivery Radius Calculations
```sql
-- Sophisticated geo-spatial delivery logic:

  RETURNS: branches within delivery range + calculated distance

DISTANCE CALCULATION:
- Uses haversine formula for accurate geo distances
- Filters branches by service area coverage
- Considers both branch calculator and delivery company limits

COVERAGE VALIDATION:
Branch serves area IF:
  (branchcalculator covers distance) OR
  (branchdelivery.maxdistance >= calculated_distance)
```

### 3.2 Driver Assignment Algorithms
```sql
-- Multi-provider delivery orchestration:

3. Check real-time availability via API calls
4. Select optimal provider based on:
   - Estimated delivery time
   - Cost optimization
   - Customer preferences
   - Provider reliability scores

INTEGRATION ENDPOINTS (from appsettings):

```

### 3.4 Zone-Based Pricing
```sql

- area: District/neighborhood
- subarea: Specific zone
- fees: Zone-specific delivery fee

ZONE PRICING HIERARCHY:
1. Specific subarea fee (most granular)

    """
    # 1. Filter providers by capability
    capable_providers = []
    for provider in available_providers:
